# Spatial Data Science with R
#### Course in the Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies

_The goals of this course are to get familiar with data science, with spatial data in data science problem, with techniques and tricks to using R for solving smaller problems, and with programming R to solve larger problems. The final assignment consist of either (i) writing an R package for solving a particular spatial data science problem that passes all checks cleanly, or (ii) writing an R markdown vignette that solves a non-obvious spatial data science problem._

This repository contains personal solutions for the course. These solutions are a proposed solution and can be always improved. These uploads are meant to help people to get an insight. I hope they can be useful for someone!
